Opening game.html will allow you to generate random boards, and either watch your bot play or step through one move at a time. 
Refer to http://www.scribd.com/jobs/botrace_api for available methods. gl/hf!

ps: you should be able to ignore everything in assets/, but if you want to disable the opponent bot from playing in game.html, go to assets/simplebot.js and find:
    makeMove: function() {
       // to disable to opponent, uncomment the next line
       // return PASS;

Uncomment the "return PASS;" and your bot will be free to roam the board alone.

v1 - Find best fruit to go after, sprint towards it, taking in fruits from as many non-closed fruit groups as possible.

v2 - Added check to see if you are just following the opponent. If my position is the same as opponent's last position
for 3 consecutive moves, sprint towards second best item instead of the best.

v3 - Improved weights (factored in remaining count into weight calc.)
